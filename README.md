## Overview
**M.O.T.G.** sets in a parallel universe from ours where the cold war ended with an all out war on the moon, resulting in a victory for the USSR. Since then, yearly commemoration of the event has been taking place in the form of the *Moon Games* ! 
They consist in an **obstacle course** where each driver has to **hit as many targets as possible** within a **time limit**. And what is the imposed vehicle ? *An old T-16 tank that survived the war.* I told you it was a very original tank game !
